# godot-tooling
Tooling files for working with the Godot game making software.

This project will use common tool files to help assist with working with Godot.

The idea is using explicit declaration of various aspects of tools.

gitattirbute, gitignore, editor config files, etc will explicitly declare standards for files either supported directly by Godot, or by programs often used in concert with Godot (graphic editor programs).

Suggetions and improvements welcome.
