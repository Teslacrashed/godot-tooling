# godot-tooling
Tooling files for working with the Godot game making software.

This is a series of "dotfiles" (files that start with a `.` before their name), which are often used by tools like git, vim, or Editor Config.

Godot itself does not normally use these files, they are often used by other tools one may use with Godot projects.

The idea is using explicit declaration of various aspects of tools.

gitattirbute, gitignore, editor config files, etc will explicitly declare standards for files either supported directly by Godot, or by programs often used in concert with Godot (graphic editor programs).

Many files are commented to help state what kind and/or type files are, and it is my hope that this helps new Godot users understand what they are working with.

Suggetions and improvements welcome.

# Editor Config
https://editorconfig.org

To my knowledge, Godot does not understand or use .editorconfig files, but many may still use it if they work with Visual Studio Code.
Again, the file is here to help bring understanding of what file types and what standards (tabs or spaces, CRLF or LF line-endings, etc) are common for various files.
